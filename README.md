Installation Guide

Prerequisites:
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
Python 3.12

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

        git clone https://github.com/Xyveran/csms_summarize

        conda activate summarization_env

If you donâ€™t have the environment.yml file, you can manually create the environment:

        conda create -n summarization_env python=3.12
        conda activate summarization_env

Step 3: Install Dependencies Using pip
Once the environment is active, run the following command to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Set Up Visusal Studio Code
Install the Python extension for VS Code.
